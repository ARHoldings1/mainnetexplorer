        <h2>16. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
        <h3>16.1. Entire Agreement; Order of Precedence</h3>
        <p>These Terms contain the entire agreement, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings between the parties regarding the Services. These Terms do not alter the terms or conditions of any other electronic or written agreement you may have with Company for the Services or for any other Company product or service or otherwise. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any other agreement you may have with Company, the terms of that other agreement will control only if these Terms are specifically identified and declared to be overridden by such other agreement.</p>

        <h3>16.2. Amendment</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to make changes or modifications to these Terms from time to time, in our sole discretion. Amended Terms will become effective immediately on the date they are posted to the Services unless we state otherwise via our notice of such amended Terms. Any amended Terms will apply prospectively to use of the Services after such changes become effective. Your continued use of the Services following the effective date of such changes will constitute your acceptance of such changes. If you do not agree to any amended Terms, you must discontinue using the Services.</p>

        <h3>16.3. Waiver</h3>
        <p>Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under these Terms will not operate as a waiver thereof.</p>

        <h3>16.4. Severability</h3>
        <p>The invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which will remain in full force and effect.</p>

        <p>Company will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from any event beyond Company's reasonable control, including, but not limited to, flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or other act of God, fire, war, insurrection, riot, labor dispute, accident, action of government, communications, power failure, or equipment or software malfunction (each, a "Force Majeure Event").</p>

        <h3>16.6. Assignment</h3>
        <p>You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without prior written consent from Company, including by operation of law or in connection with any change of control.
